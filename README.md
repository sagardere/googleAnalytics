If you have a primary Google account that you use for other services like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google+, or YouTube, then you should set up your Google Analytics using that Google account. Or you will need to create a new one.

2. Once you are finished, Do go to `Admin -> User Managment -> Tracking Info -> Tracking Code` Then you will get or show your Google Analytics code. Like `Trcking Id and Global Site Tag (gtag.js)` After that copy the gtag.js file code.

3. If you have a website built with HTML files, you will add the tracking code before the </head> tag on each of your pages. This must be installed on every page on your website, like following, 

 clone the repository, then run the following command inside the directory certsFiles.

4. Now start server by running:

npm start

Open your favourite browser and visit https://localhost:3000 and you should see Hello World.

You may see some SSL warning. That’s because your certificate isn’t issued by any verified organization. What you want to do is, add the crt as an exception to your browser.
